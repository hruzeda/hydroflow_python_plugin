Plugin to compute drainage orders in drainage basins using Strahler and Shreve methods, and to optimize monitoring stations distribution using the Sharp method.

Created with Plugin Builder.

This a fork/rewrite of https://github.com/sistemalabgis/hydroflow that also integrates https://github.com/leonardguedes/MonitorPoint/blob/main/MonitorPointcode.

TODO:
- A few of our model and utility classes are already covered by PyQT5/PyQT6 and could be replaced
- Python camel_case naming convention should be followed for vars/attrs/funcs (pylintrc: C0103)
